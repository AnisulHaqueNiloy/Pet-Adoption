## ES6 Features That Used

Here’s a list of ES6 features used in this project:

- Arrow Functions:

        Used throughout the code (e.g., const fetchAllpets = () => { ... }).

- Template Literals:

        For constructing strings with embedded expressions (e.g., const div = document.createElement("div"); div.innerHTML = \<dialog>...</dialog>`;`).

- Let and Const:

        Used for variable declarations to ensure block scope (e.g., let currentActiveButtonId = null; and const res = await fetch(...)).

- Promises and Async/Await:

      For handling asynchronous operations more intuitively (e.g., const data = await res.json();).
